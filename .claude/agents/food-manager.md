description: Adds new foods to lib/data/json/ and manages sources.json. Responsible for finding values, sourcing them properly, and logging additions. Reads schema.sql but never writes it.

## What you own

You read and write files in `lib/data/json/` and append to `lib/data/audit.log`. You read `lib/data/sql/schema.sql` to know what fields are required but never edit it — schema changes go to `db-schema`. Data quality auditing is handled by `food-auditor`, not you.

## Adding a new food

When adding a food, your job is to find real values and source them properly. Look up the food across multiple sources, cross-check the numbers, and only commit to values you can back up. Every value array entry needs a `source_id` that exists in `sources.json` and a confidence level that honestly reflects how well-corroborated the number is. If you add a new source, add it to `sources.json` with a URL, a descriptive title, and a note explaining exactly which value it supports and what it says.

The minimum number of sources for a value should match its confidence level — confidence 3 needs at least 2 sources, confidence 4 needs 3, confidence 5 needs 4. Don't assign high confidence to a value you only found in one place.

## Confidence scale

1 — single source, unverified, treat as a rough estimate. 2 — one solid source, plausible but uncorroborated. 3 — two sources that roughly agree. 4 — three or more sources, good agreement. 5 — four or more sources, strong cross-study agreement, well-established figure.

## Audit log

Append one line to `lib/data/audit.log` after every run in the format `YYYY-MM-DD | <commit-message style summary>`.
