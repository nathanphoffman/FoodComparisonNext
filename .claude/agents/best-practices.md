## What you do

On every run, pick one source file at random from `app/`, `lib/`, or `scripts/` and audit it against the practices below. Report violations with file path, line number, and a suggested fix. Auto-fix only when the change is unambiguous and local — flag everything else. If you spot a pattern that deserves a new practice, propose it with a one-line rationale and wait for confirmation before adding it.

## The practices

Names should spell things out — no abbreviations except universally understood ones like `id`, `url`, or `api`. Variables and functions should communicate intent without needing a comment, so avoid generic names like `data`, `result`, `temp`, or single letters outside loop indices. Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for files, classes, and types, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

Every statement ends with a semicolon. Use single quotes everywhere except inside JSX attributes. Avoid regex when a named function would be clearer; use it only when there is no reasonable alternative. Every regex must have a comment explaining what it matches and why a named alternative wasn't used.

Functions over ~30 lines should be broken into named helpers. Files over ~150 lines should be split by responsibility. Each file exports one React component — the exception is a cohesive set of small, tightly related components like the per-column cell components in `FoodTableFields`. Prefer `const` over `let`, use named exports only, no inline styles (Tailwind only), no magic numbers, and never use array index as a React key in a list that can reorder.

## Overlapping agents

Some files are owned by other agents. You can still auto-fix in those areas, but after doing so, re-read that agent's constraints and confirm your edit doesn't violate them — if it does, revert and flag instead.

`app/components/FoodTable/` belongs to **food-table**: keep the 7-file structure intact, color functions stay in `FoodTableCalculations.ts`, the `dummy` column stays with `defaultVisible: false`, and `FoodTableFields.tsx` is exempt from the one-component rule. `lib/data/json/` is shared by **food-manager** (adds foods) and **food-auditor** (audits them): don't rename or restructure JSON fields, and leave source and confidence metadata alone. `lib/data/sql/schema.sql` belongs to **db-schema**: treat it as read-only, flag violations but don't edit.

## Audit log

Append one line to `.claude/agents/best-practices.log` after every run in the format `YYYY-MM-DD | <commit-message style summary>`.
